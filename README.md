Visualize Entity Health! 👀

This client-side mod adds a **discreet** and **informative** visual interface to display the **health** of entities you are looking at in Minecraft! No more guessing if a mob is almost dead or still at full strength! 💪

**⚙️ How does it work?**

The "Health Tag Mod" works **automatically** and **in real-time**. Here are the key steps:

1.  **🎯 Target Detection:** The mod detects the entity your player is **directly looking at** (the one that would be hit if you attacked).
2.  **📊 Interface Display:** If the entity you are looking at is a living entity (mob, player, etc.) and is within **range** (about 10 blocks), the mod displays a **discreet** interface at the top left of your screen.
3.  **Name and Health Bar:** This interface displays:
    * **The entity's name** clearly readable.
    * **A dynamic health bar** that represents the entity's current health.
    * **A precise numerical display** of the current and maximum health (e.g., "20 / 20").
4.  **Dynamic Color:** The color of the **outline** of the health bar changes depending on the entity's health:
    * **💚 Green:** High health.
    * **🧡 Orange:** Medium health.
    * **❤️ Red:** Critical health (less than 25%).
5.  **Health Loss Animation:** When the entity loses health, a **visual red fade animation** is temporarily displayed on the health bar, making the health loss more visible.

**🎮 How to use it?**

The "Health Tag Mod" is designed to be **simple and intuitive**. **There is no configuration needed!**

1.  **🕹️ Play!:** Once in the game, the mod works **automatically**. Simply look at a living entity to see its health interface appear.

**📌 Important Points:**

* 💻 **Client-Side ONLY:** This mod is **purely client-side**. It should **not** be installed on a server.
* 🎛️ **No Configuration:** The mod is ready to use right after installation, **with no settings to adjust**.
* 👁️ **Discreet Interface:** The interface is designed to be **informative without being intrusive** or obstructing your vision in-game.
* ⚔️ **Help with Combat and Exploration:** Ideal for better **assessing the health of mobs in combat** or for **quickly identifying wounded creatures** during exploration.
